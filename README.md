# Master
The classes used for simulating LiNiPO4 and scripts for analysis.

The code listed here is tidied up for clarity. It is the same code used for the simulations, but old comments have been removed, etc. It is possible that I have managed to remove a semicolon or something along those lines. For those of you who are interested in running the code, I have put the untidied version in its own folder, Code_for_running.

A few Python scripts for analysing the code has been included. The folder Analysis contains a script for plotting the spin correlation function along (0,K,0) and a script for finding the critical exponent nu using Bootstrap data from Binder. Implementations of the Bootstrap procedure is included in the folder Analysis/Bootstrap.
